// UniswapV2Pair.sol
function _safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint value) private {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20(token).transfer.selector, to, value));
    require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), 'UniswapV2: TRANSFER_FAILED');
}
```
**Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method:** call, abi.encodeWithSelector, abi.decode

# Explanation

**Purpose:**
The `_safeTransfer` function is designed to safely transfer ERC-20 tokens from the contract to a specified address. It ensures that the transfer operation is successful and reverts the transaction if it fails. This is a critical function to handle token transfers within the Uniswap V2 protocol, ensuring smooth operation of liquidity pools and swaps.

**Detailed Usage:**

- **call:**The call method is a low-level function used to interact with other contracts. It is preferred here because it allows the contract to handle token transfers in a more flexible way compared to high-level functions like transfer or send. This flexibility is crucial when dealing with a variety of ERC-20 token implementations that might behave differently.
- **abi.encodeWithSelector:** This function encodes the function selector (i.e., the first four bytes of the keccak256 hash of the function signature) along with the function arguments (to and value). This encoding prepares the data payload for the call method. Essentially, it creates the exact bytecode needed to invoke the transfer function on the ERC-20 token contract.
- **abi.decode:** After making the call, the function decodes the returned data to ensure the operation was successful. It handles the cases where the token contract might return a boolean value indicating success. The use of abi.decode ensures that the function can interpret the response correctly and handle different token implementations.

The combination of these methods ensures that the _safeTransfer function can robustly interact with ERC-20 tokens, handling both standard and non-standard implementations.

**Impact:**
The _safeTransfer function plays a crucial role in the UniswapV2Pair contract by ensuring secure and reliable token transfers. Its impact on the smart contract and the protocol includes:

- **Security:** By using low-level calls and proper error handling, the function ensures that token transfers do not fail silently. If a transfer operation fails, the transaction is reverted, preventing any potential loss of funds or inconsistencies in the protocol’s state.
- **Compatibility:** The use of abi.encodeWithSelector and abi.decode allows the function to handle a wide range of ERC-20 token implementations, including those that may not strictly follow the ERC-20 standard. This broad compatibility is vital for a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, which needs to support as many tokens as possible.
- **Reliability:** The function’s design ensures that token transfers are executed correctly, maintaining the reliability and trustworthiness of the Uniswap protocol. Reliable token transfers are essential for liquidity providers and traders who depend on the protocol for their financial activities.
- **Operational Integrity:** By ensuring that token transfers are performed safely and correctly, the _safeTransfer function contributes to the overall operational integrity of the Uniswap V2 protocol. This integrity is essential for maintaining user confidence and the smooth operation of the protocol’s liquidity pools and swap functions.
